# Booger

A game like Boggle but not really.

[Play it here :3](https://wdi-sg.github.io/wdi-project-1-imouto2005/)

## Gameplay

Form as many long words as you can from the given set of alphabets!

Each player will receive points based on the number of characters used in their word.
Eg. "food" gets 4 points, "bread" gets 5 points

"Rare" characters such as "Q", "Z", "X", "J", "K" or "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y" will get you an extra 5 or 3 points respectively.
Eg. "kick" gets 4 + 5 + 5 = 14 points, "wave" gets 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 points
      
Any words less than three characters long will be considered invalid.
      
No points will be awarded if a word has been played by ANY player in the same game, so be sure to play all your best possible words as early in the game as possible!
